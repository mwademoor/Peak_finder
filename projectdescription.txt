In this project I will find a peak in noisy data. 

I will use a structured python file, with classes and using tests. 

First we have to import the data

Then we have to look for the peak. 
First we have to determine a threshold: get it from average and sdv from signal
Check if there are more points around it.
Output: position(s)

Then we fit the peak.
Input: data, position
Output: fit data 

Plot function optional


<<<<<<< HEAD
Test functions: 
generate signal 
test if it finds the right peaks
